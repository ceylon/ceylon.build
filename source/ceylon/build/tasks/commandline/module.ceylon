"""This modules provides functions to execute commands.
   
   The following example will create a task that when called will execute `git pull` command.
   ```ceylon
   Task updateTask = command("git pull");
   ```
   [[command]] function is a `Task` wrapper for [[executeCommand]] function.
   
   Commands are executed in a synchronous way. This means that both functions will wait
   for command to exit before returning.
